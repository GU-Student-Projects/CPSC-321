# CPSC-321
CPSC 321 - Database Management Systems - 2023 Fall
Class taught by Professor Shawn Bowers

## Concepts Developed

* SQL
* MariaDB
* UML Diagrams
* Relational Algebra
* HTML
* NodeJS / PHP (you get to choose which one)

## Description

This is a repository that contains the SQL queries for the different assignments in the class.
The intended purpose of this repository is to show others what they might be working on when they sign up for this class, but can also be a resource if you need help with SQL queries! NodeJS and PHP weren't really explained so I'm probably using it wrong (Look at the "project" folder) but it still works. Definitely look there for trying to figure out how to make a website for your final project if you need that help!
